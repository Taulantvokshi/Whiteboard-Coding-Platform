Whiteboard is a social platform web application that helps new developers to practice and simulate coding interviews.
A developer can find, search or create a new event of their choice and join groups of people that share the same interest.

The main page of the whiteboard is the place where people have the ability to orient and find Events only by exploring the map each colored pointer is an event and just by checking the color of the pins you know what programing language the event represents, or by clicking, in that case, you will be redirected to that event page. I used the Google Geolocation API for mapping users addresses and then I implemented the results on the third-party map provider - Mapbox.

By signing up have access to the events page where you can add an event or join one. You have a personalized dashboard to check which events you are attending or the ones that you organized. I implemented a very fast searching algorithm that can help you to search for a specific event by multiple attributes like programming
